## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/UJ2406/Network_Scanner.git
    cd Network_Scanner
    ```

2. **Python 3.6+ Required**  
    Recommended: Python 3.8 or higher

3. **Install Dependencies**  
    All dependencies are from the Python standard library (no pip needed!):
    - `socket`
    - `threading`
    - `json`
    - `ssl`
    - `datetime`
    - `subprocess`
    - `os`
    - `re`
    - `concurrent.futures`

    *No external modules required.*

4. **Run the Tool**

    ```
    python3 nsc.py
    ```

## 🖥️ Usage

- Launch script and use the interactive menu to:
    - Quick, full, or custom port scan a host/IP
    - Review open ports and matched vulnerabilities (auto-suggested by port)
    - Show network/interface details
    - Configure scanning options (thread count, port range)
    - Export scan results as a JSON report
- Full help and safety tips are built into the interface (`Help` menu).

## 🔒 Security Concepts Learned

- **Port scanning**: Identifying service exposure and initial attack surface
- **Vulnerability mapping**: Matching open ports to known high-risk services
- **Banner grabbing**: Collecting version information—vital for exploit research
- **SSL/TLS check**: Surface level certificate/cipher info for common secure protocols
- **Multithreading**: Efficient parallel scanning to minimize total scan time
- **Network hygiene**: Seeing real security posture, not just theoretical exposure

---

## 🧩 Good to Know / Best Practices

- Run with permission only—**unauthorized scanning is illegal!**
- For best results, scan a target on the same network or properly configured external host ("scanme.nmap.org" is safe for testing).
- Increase thread count for speed, but be mindful of DoS/false positives.
- Full range scans (1-65535) may take longer—limit range for targeted/efficient checks.
- For deep vulnerability scanning, follow up with specialized tools (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS).

## ❗ Legal/Ethical Notice

- **Only scan assets/networks you own or have written permission to assess.**
- Misuse is illegal and against community guidelines.
